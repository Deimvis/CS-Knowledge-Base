# Present and Future of Distributed Systems

## Current State

* Moore's law is dead

* Domain-specific hardware is not enough

* Huge demand from deep learning

* Data gets bigger

* Emergence of new abstractions

* Delegation of managing distributed systems to other companies

## Trends

* Distributed systems become more popular (especially from DL)
* Distributed systems need more abstractions to simplify and hide complex approaches
